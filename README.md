The 3 different fetch requests ('get','post','delete') are all contained within the notesRouter.js and utilize functions ('read','append','delete') are all in individual script files in the utils directory. The notes router is routed through the indexRouter.js and utilized in the server.js. The '/' route and the '*' route are both hosted in the server.js script file.
